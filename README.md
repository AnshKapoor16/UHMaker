## Algorithm
The algorithm used is developed in Python using libraries such as:

**SciPy -** Used for interpolation and formation of the graph.

**Matplotlib -** Used to plot the graph.

**Numpy -** Used to access functions of numpy.

**OpenPyxl -** Used to connect the algorithm and export the graph to excel.

## Graphical User Interface(GUI)
The GUI is also developed in Python and the libraries used include:

**QT -** Qt is cross-platform software for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms.

**->PyQT -** PyQt is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt, implemented as a Python plug-in used to import widgets and load UI screens. 

**->QTDesigner -** Qt Designer is a Qt tool used for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Qt Widgets
